# **Project Assumption Details**

For this take-home assignment, I have developed an application called Zukulia, an online shopping platform using Angular, with the following assumptions:

---

## **1. Angular Version**
- Utilized the latest version of Angular (v19.x) to ensure the application is built with the most up-to-date features and improvements.

---

## **2. Usability and Responsiveness**
- Since the usability of the application (desktop-only or multi-device) was not specified, a **mobile-friendly responsive design** was implemented to support all screen sizes and provide a better user experience.

---

## **3. Filtering**
- The requirement specified filtering based on **category** only, so filtering functionality was implemented accordingly.
- Other filter options (e.g., filtering by all fields) were not included to stay within the scope of the requirements.

---

## **4. Sorting and Pagination**
- Sorting and pagination were not implemented, as the focus of the assignment is to build a simple application with **clean, maintainable code** and **best Angular practices**.

---

## **5. Login and Profile Pages**
- Features such as login or profile pages were **not included**, as they were not part of the provided design or requirements.

---

This approach ensured that the application met the stated requirements while adhering to clean coding practices and best practices for Angular development.
