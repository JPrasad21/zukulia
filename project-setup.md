# **Project Setup Explanation**

For this take-home assignment, I focused on setting up a robust, maintainable, and scalable Angular application. Here's a breakdown of the tools and technologies I utilized:

## **Frameworks and Libraries**
### 1. **Angular 19**
- Used as the core framework for building a dynamic, scalable, and efficient frontend application.
- Followed best Angular practices, including modular structure, reusable components, and services.

### 2. **Tailwind CSS**
- Implemented for streamlined styling and rapid UI development.
- Used for building a clean and responsive design.

### 3. **Angular Material**
- Used for pre-designed components to ensure a consistent and professional UI experience.
- Included Material Icons for enhanced visual clarity and user interaction.

## **Code Quality and Consistency**
### 4. **Angular ESLint**
- Integrated to maintain consistent coding standards and identify potential issues early in the development cycle.

### 5. **Prettier**
- Configured as the code formatter to enforce a uniform code style, improving readability and maintainability.

### 6. **SonarCloud Extension**
- Incorporated to analyze code quality, identify code smells, and enforce clean code principles directly within the IDE (VS Code).

## **Additional Notes**
- **Structure**: The project is designed with a modular architecture to promote reusability and scalability.
- **Accessibility and Responsiveness**: Tailwind CSS and Angular Material were leveraged to ensure the application is both responsive and accessible across devices.
- **Error Handling**: Added error-handling mechanisms to provide a seamless user experience.
